Question 1
What will the code below output to the console and why ?
console.log(1 + "2" + "2");
console.log(1 + +"2" + "2");
console.log(1 + -"1" + "2");
console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2");
console.log( "A" - "B" + "2");
console.log( "A" - "B" + 2);

Solution1 - here is the output for code in question
	VM43:1 122
	VM43:2 32
	VM43:3 02
	VM43:4 112
	VM43:5 NaN2
	VM43:6 NaN
	undefined
	The code output is as above because 
	*+ operator is used to join the two different datatypes while logging or printing.

	*In first case console.log(1 + "2" + "2") is just getting added as data types 	are 		integer and string

	*when any operator is included just before integer value casted to string then it 		converts to integer and acts as integer inthe statement, like in 
	console.log(1 + +"2" + "2") and console.log(1 + -"1" + "2")

	*but whenever operator is inserted before a string having alphabetic characters inside 	then the corresponding value beconmes the Nan like in 5th and 6th line


Question 2
You are given a variable “marks”. Your task is to print:
- AA if the mark is greater than 90
- AB if the mark is greater than 80 and less than or equal to 90
- BB if the mark is greater than 70and less than or equal to 80
- BC if the mark is greater than 60 and less than or equal to 70
- CC if the mark is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 60
- CD if the mark is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50
- DD if the mark is greater than 30 and less than or equal to 40
- FF if the mark is less than or equal to 30


Solution2 -  
	if(marks > 90){
	    console.log("AA");
	} else if(marks>80 && marks<= 90){
	    console.log("AB");
	} else if(marks>70 && marks<= 80){
	    console.log("BB");
	} else if(marks>60 && marks<=70){
	    colsole.log("BC");
	} else if(marks>50 && marks <=60){
	    console.log("CC");
	} else if(marks>40 && marks<=50){
	    console.log("CD");
	} else if(marks >30 && marks<=40){
	    console.log("DD");
	} else if(marks >20 && marks<= 30){
	    console.log("FF");
	} else{
	    console.log("FF");
	}


	it gives the output

	VM1432:10 CC
	undefined
