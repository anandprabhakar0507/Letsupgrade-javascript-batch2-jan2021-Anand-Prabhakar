Question 1
What is the value of clothes[0] and why?
const clothes = ['jacket', 't-shirt'];
clothes.length = 0;
console.log(clothes[0]);

Solution - The length property behaves differently as it deletes all elements array when we 	set to 0.
	Here last line console.log(clothes[0]) returns nothing as we have already set the 		length property to 0.But, if we do not write the second line clothes.length = 0, 		then we get the acquired result as usual.
	we get the output undefined when we run the code in file.



Question 2
Write a Javascript program to find the sum of all elements of a given array?

Solution - 
	var array = [55,27,230,56,70,1];
	sum = 0
	var i;
	for(i = 0; i<array.length; i++){
    	sum = sum + array[i];}
	console.log("Sum of Numbers in array is: " +sum);

	VM466:1 Sum of Numbers in array is: 439
	undefined
