Question 1
	Write a JavaScript program to display the reading status (i.e. display book name, 	author name,
	and reading status) of the following books.
	var library = [
	{
	author: 'Bill Gates',
	title: 'The Road Ahead',
	readingStatus: true
	},
	{
	author: 'Steve Jobs',
	title: 'Walter Isaacson',
	readingStatus: true
	},
	{
	author: 'Suzanne Collins',
	title: 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games',
	readingStatus: false
	}];

	The output should look like this:
	Already read 'Bill Gates' by The Road Ahead.
	Already read 'Steve Jobs' by Walter Isaacson.
	You still need to read 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games' by Suzanne
	Collins.

	title: 'The Road Ahead',
	readingStatus: true
	},
	{
	author: 'Steve Jobs',
	title: 'Walter Isaacson',
	readingStatus: true
	},
	{
	author: 'Suzanne Collins',
	title: 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games',
	readingStatus: false

	/*Already read 'Bill Gates' by The Road Ahead.
	Already read 'Steve Jobs' by Walter Isaacson.
	You still need to read 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games' by Suzanne
	Collins.*/

	var i=0;
	for(i; i< library.length ; i++){
	    if(library[i]['readingStatus'] == true){
	        console.log("Already read \'" +library[i]['author']+ "\' by "+library[i]	['title']);}
	    else{
	        console.log("You still need to read \'" +library[i]['title']+ "\' by " 	+library[i]['author']);}
	}
